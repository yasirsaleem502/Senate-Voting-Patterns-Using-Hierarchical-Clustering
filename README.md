## Project Overview
This project explores the voting patterns of U.S. Senators using Hierarchical Clustering to identify natural groupings based on their voting behaviors. The clustering reveals alliances, polarization, and bipartisan voting blocks within the Senate, offering a fresh perspective on political dynamics.

## Introduction
The Senate is often polarized along party lines, but there are instances where bipartisan cooperation occurs. By applying Hierarchical Clustering, this project aims to group senators based on the similarity of their voting records, revealing key insights into voting blocks, outliers, and coalition building.

## Features

Hierarchical Clustering: Uses agglomerative clustering to create a hierarchy of voting similarities among senators.
Visualization: Dendrogram plots visualize the clustering process and highlight voting groups.
Voting Insights: Identifies patterns of party loyalty, bipartisan coalitions, and outlier behavior in the Senate.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:


## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Voting records are cleaned and transformed into a numerical format.
Clustering Algorithm:
Hierarchical Clustering is applied using the Euclidean distance metric.
The clustering algorithm groups senators based on voting similarity.
Visualization: A Dendrogram is generated to visualize the hierarchical structure of clusters.

## Results
The clustering results reveal clear divisions along party lines but also highlight bipartisan clusters and outliers.
A dendrogram visualizes how senators are grouped based on their voting patterns.
